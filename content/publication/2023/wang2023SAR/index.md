abstract:   In recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, a neural vocoder often generates speech samples by solely conditioning on acoustic features predicted from an acoustic model. However, there are always distortions existing in the predicted acous- tic features, compared to those of the groundtruth, especially in the common case of poor acoustic modeling due to low- quality training data. To overcome such limits, we propose a Self-supervised learning framework to learn an Anti-distortion acoustic Representation (SAR) to replace human-crafted acoustic features by introducing distortion prior to an auto-encoder pre- training process. The learned acoustic representation from the proposed framework is proved anti-distortion compared to the most commonly used mel-spectrogram through both objective and subjective evaluation.

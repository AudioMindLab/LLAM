abstract:   This paper proposes Shoggoth, an efficient edge- cloud collaborative architecture, for boosting inference perfor- mance on real-time video of changing scenes. Shoggoth uses online knowledge distillation to improve the accuracy of models suffering from data drift and offloads the labeling process to the cloud, alleviating constrained resources of edge devices. At the edge, we design adaptive training using small batches to adapt models under limited computing power, and adaptive sampling of training frames for robustness and reducing bandwidth. The evaluations on the realistic dataset show 15%â€“20% model accuracy improvement compared to the edge-only strategy and fewer network costs than the cloud-only strategy.

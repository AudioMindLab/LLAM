abstract: The problem of singing voice detection is to segment a song into vocal and non-vocal parts. Commonly used methods usually train a model on a set of frame-based features and then predict the unknown frames by the model. However, the multi-dimensional features are usually concatenated together for each frame, with little consideration of spatial information. Hence, a deep fusion method of the Multi-feature dimensions with Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) is proposed. A one dimension convolution is made on feature dimensions for each frames, then the high-level features obtained can be used for a direct binary classification. The performance of the proposed method is on par with the state-of-art methods on public dataset.
